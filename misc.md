# Misc stuff

## Levels of drunkenness

In order:

* You are sober
* You are slightly buzzed
* You are buzzed
* You are heavily buzzed
* You are a bit tipsy
* You are tipsy
* You are somewhat drunk
* You are somewhat intoxicated
* You are drunk
* You are intoxicated
* You've had enough to drink
* You are wasted
* You are very drunk
* You are shit-faced
* You are sloppy drunk
* You are so drunk, even your pet dog looks cute
* You surface from the bottle only to get some air
* You have alcohol poisoning

At this point, you will fall over and not be able to drink any more: "You can't seem to get close enough to your mouth."

You "get drunk" much faster than you "sober up", so whilst drinking from sober, you'll notice some stages are skipped.
